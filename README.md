Final Project For UF CJC Capstone Course

    This project is created as the final capstone project for the Masters in Web Design and Online Communication program at the University of Florida. 

    The site will serve as a resource to assist with the creation of color palettes which the user can then utilize for any creative projects. By incorporating the Colormind API (colormind.io) to assist with random color generation, the user can select their desired starting color and refresh the screen to return a variety of different palette options to go along with that color.
